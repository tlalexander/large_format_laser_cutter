# large_format_laser_cutter
A laser cutter designed for cutting fabric. Because it is so large, it can hide under your rug when not in use.

Right now the files are all in OnShape, a free cloud based CAD program. You can edit and download all the files here:

I will be documenting this more when I can. If you want to contribute, we could use a directory of the STL files in a pull request.

Here is a video of the first full range of motion test.

Since it is designed to cut fabrics for sewing, there is also a camera for scanning in existing patterns. Code TBD
